They maintain their numbers in different excel sheets. 

Nowadays, the country sales director of this company having some issues while working with the sales insights. He is not getting 
data properly and with the given data, he sees the difference between reality and the illustration. The area sales managers 
inform him through phone calls about the monthly sals. He found out that they mostly exaggerate the numbers, which creates more 
complexity in the whole business intelligence process. 

After when he asked the area managers to provide him some excel sheets to visualize the scenario, he was given 60+ sheets. It created more 
puzzling situation. He wants to improve this scenario right now.
